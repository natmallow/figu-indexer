                                We are the Arizona FIGU-Interest Group for mission knowledge. FIGU is an acronym
                                for the German words "Freie Interessengemeinschaft Universell" which means
                                Free Community of Interests Universal. Our mission is to disseminate and study the Teaching
                                of the Truth, Teaching of the Creation Energy (Spirit) and the Teaching of the Life provided by FIGU.
                                We hold a monthly meeting in Sedona, AZ in which we participate in the Salome Peace
                                Meditation and study the Geisteslehre (Spiritual Teaching). We do not discriminate based upon race, gender, sexual
                                orientation, nationality, age, handicap or any other differentiating human characteristics. We are a non-religious
                                group and are not affiliated with any political, religious or any other secular organizations. We do not wish
                                to influence, coerce, or change any individual's thinking but simply aim to present information for

                            <p>With regard to the above proclamation of the
                                Plejaren committee, it should be added that this
                                became necessary because questions are
                                repeatedly raised as to whether objects seen or
                                sometimes filmed or photographed were Plejaren
                                objects/beam ships/ UFOs. This can – as we have known for some time – be
                                categorically denied. As a rule, these are objects
                                from foreign extraterrestrials or test missiles of
                                terrestrial manufacture.According to the unanimous statements of all
                                Plejaren, they consistently keep their distance
                                from Earth’s human beings as well as from other
                                extraterrestrials who have been active in the
                                terrestrial space for tens of thousands of years and
                                who they call &#39;the strangers/foreigners&#39;.
                            </p>
                            <p>If in the past sightings and photos/recordings of
                                Plejaren persons or spaceships were made, then
                                with very isolated exceptions – which for the
                                witnesses came about through lucky causal
                                foreordination – this was exclusively because the
                                Plejaren wanted to create evidence for their
                                presence and consciously permitted or allowed
                                these &#39;sightings&#39;.
                                Above and beyond that, there have been neither
                                sightings by nor contacts with any Earth human
                                beings or other extraterrestrials, who are neither
                                able to locate the Plejaren nor make contact with
                                them.</p>
                            <p>The explanation for the Plejaren contacts with
                                &#39;Billy&#39; Eduard Albert Meier is based solely on the
                                fact that he is the carrier of the thousands of
                                millions of years old Nokodemion Creation-energy
                                form, which has an extremely great and deep
                                knowledge concerning the Creation-energy
                                teaching, in which the Plejaren are interested
                                because this teaching has been taught among
                                them for millions of years.</p>

                                the Plejaren committee, Safaar, the twin
                                brother of Sfath, made the following
                                statement on 29 August 2023:</h3>
                            <p><strong>Safaar:</strong> <i>"However, what I now have to explain with
                                regard to your question is that we Plejaren – and
                                indeed already our earliest ancestors – have
                                remained here on Earth because foresighted ones
                                have recognised that in the far future the human
                                beings here on this world will get very badly out of
                                the control of the good human nature and indulge
                                in belief in gods and all evil, hatred, killing,
                                revenge, persecution and wars and thus murdering
                                and so forth, as has already been the case with our
                                primeval peoples, whose most distant future
                                peoples only found true peace some 50,000 years
                                ago according to the earthly calendar, which had
                                already been striven for over millions of years
                                through the efforts of righteous people and their
                                successors and successors and successors, and so forth.
                                And when this finally became reality, the
                                beginning was not easy because there were still no
                                human beings who really knew how true peace
                                had to be created, formed and handled. Later,
                                however, this changed, when humans and human-
                                like beings developed naturally into beings of
                                peace. ..."</i></p>
                            <p><i>"We Plejaren, however, do not come to Earth to
                                make contact with Earth human beings, and in fact
                                we do not want anything from them, just as we do
                                not want to make contact with the
                                &#39;strangers/foreigners&#39;, as we call them, but we only
                                come here because you teach and spread the
                                teaching of Nokodemion, which has been
                                established since time immemorial, to Earth
                                human beings. To do something like this was
                                already decided some 25 million years ago by our
                                distant ancestors of that time, indeed even though
                                they themselves had succumbed to the same evils
                                as later the human beings on this world of Earth
                                did. But the righteous ones of the peoples of that
                                time already determined the becoming of the
                                mission on this world in this DERN universe some
                                25 million years ago, and the decision of that time
                                actually endured for 25 million years. However,
                                more than 50,000 years ago, the resolution that
                                had survived until then was taken up and it was
                                decided that the request that had been made at
                                that time should now be put into practice, and
                                consequently everything was prepared such that
                                that which had been decided could come about.
                                Then everything was arranged the exact moment
                                that the intended mission could begin and thus the
                                &#39;teaching of truth, teaching of the Creation-energy,
                                teaching of life&#39; could find its beginning on this
                                world, which means the real life of the human
                                being, the way he/she should follow and the value
                                he/she should develop in himself/herself and
                                become a truthly human being."</i></p>
